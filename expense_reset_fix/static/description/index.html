                In the standard Odoo workflow, correcting a posted expense report can be messy. It generates "Reversal" journal entries, polluting your General Ledger, and completely locks expenses paid by the company.
                <b>Expense Reset Fix</b> optimizes this process by allowing you to edit expenses without creating reversal entries and unlocks the ability to edit company-paid expenses.

                <p>
                    Resetting a posted expense sheet will delete the <b>existing</b> Journal Entry instead of creating a reversal entry. Your ledger remains clean.

                <p>
                    When you re-post the corrected expense, the module posts the new journal entry. No duplicate records, no clutter, no problem.

                    If you decide to delete a draft expense sheet, the linked draft journal entry is automatically deleted to prevent orphaned records.

            <div class="alert alert-info" style="padding:15px; border-radius:5px;">
                <h4 style="margin-top:0;">Scenario 1: Employee (To Reimburse)</h4>
                <p>
                    <b>Problem:</b> You post an expense of $15. You realize a mistake and reset it. Odoo creates a -$15 reversal. You add a line and re-post. Odoo creates a new entry. You now have 3 entries for one report.<br/>
                    <b>Solution:</b> With this module, pulling the expense report back to draft deletes the $15 Journal Entry record and the Payment Record, if one exists. After your changes, re-posting updates that same entry. Result: <b>Only 1 clean entry.</b>
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="alert alert-info" style="padding:15px; border-radius:5px; margin-top:20px;">
                <h4 style="margin-top:0;">Scenario 2: Company (Company Account)</h4>
                <p>
                    <b>Problem:</b> Expenses paid by the company move to "Done" state immediately after posting. The "Reset to Draft" button disappears, making corrections impossible.<br/>
                    <b>Solution:</b> This module brings back the "Reset to Draft" button for company-paid expenses. It applies the same clean logic as Scenario 1, allowing you to modify and re-post without issues.
